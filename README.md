# 2048-Game

I re-created the famous 2048 game! Sadly there are no twists, but I can proudly say that I created everything from scratch, including the engine and the graphics! This was done using SFML (Simple Fast Media Library) and C++. If you want to play, just download, extract, and run the "2048 Sharable.zip" file!
